                <h2>What are human rights and why do they matter?</h2>
                <p>It means human rights are protected by international law and some states have integrated them into their constitution.
                    But human rights are still often ignored or abused across the world.
                    That's because it's hard to enforce these rights, or to punish those who abused them, and not all states share the same values.
                    When states don't protect people's rights, pressure from the international community and NGOs can help.
                    And some cases do end up in international courts. So, where does that leave you? Knowing your rights is the first step to defending them.</p>
